library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

Load data and clean.
```{r}
train_raw <- read.csv("train.csv")
test_raw <- read.csv("test.csv")

train <- clean(train_raw)
test <- clean(test_raw, is_test=TRUE)
```

Initial Plots

```{r, echo=FALSE}
table(train$Cover_Type)

ggplot(train, aes(Cover_Type, Elevation)) + geom_boxplot()
```

* Cover type 7 likes higher elavation. Clearly 

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
